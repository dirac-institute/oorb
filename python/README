OpenOrb Python wrappers.

Installation (WITHOUT REQUIRING THE LSST STACK)
------------

1. Follow oorb installation guide to build the fortran-only, command line portions of the code.

2. To build the python bindings, cd into this directory and then
       shell> make clean
       shell> make
       shell> make pyoorb
       shell> python setup.py install

3. Test by running
       shell> python api.py
       shell> python test.py

If you get an error from python saying that liboorb cannot be found, copy
liboorb.so (or liboorb.dylib if you are on a Mac) somewhere in your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH if you are on a Mac).
Or add this directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

You might have to add the OORB_PATH/python directory to your PYTHONPATH variable (happened under Ubuntu 16.04) to run it from anywhere.

Tested on a Mac OS X system running OSX 10.5.x and gfortran 4.4.x, Ubuntu 16.04 and gfortran 5.0.4

Note that these wrappers are likely to evolve over time.
